# Hafestran Grammar
Hafestran grammar is a little bit different from Japanese grammar, and follows something closer to French grammar, which is closer to English. I have boiled down a simple process for how to understand it.

## Greeting
All sentences that introduce a topic must be a greeting: ex. Hello, Heyo, Hi, Ohaiyo.

## Agent
Agent can be thought of as the person that is being greeted: Ex. Hello Bob.

## Request
There are six different kinds of requests:

(1. Will you get.
(2. Can you get.
(3. Will you obtain.
(4. Can you obtain.
(5. Can you retrieve.
(6. Can you retrieve.

## Items
Items are structured as the gender of the item and the item word itself. Ex.

~~~
the apple
the banana
the pineapple
the orange
an apple
a banana
a pineapple
an orange
Some apples
some bananas
some pineapples
some oranges
~~~

Hafestran has male and female genders of items and objects.

Ruh, Rah, Ros - The (masculine), the (feminine), the (plural)
Yona, Yonei, Yonas - A, An, A / An (Plural)

## For_From
For_From is a collective grammar article where you choose either for or from based on context. You recieve an item from a location, or request an item for a location.

## User Location
User location, similarly to items, begin with the gender of the location, and the location itself. For sake of simplicity, I have decided to make all location female gendered.
